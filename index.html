   <header class="titles"> The Beginning...</header>
   
   <p>I was born on Christmas day in 1993. My parents tell me that it was snowing and they had just finished cleaning up
      after family had left on Christmas eve when my mom went into labor. My sister was 8 years old and she was dropped
      off at my grandparents' house on my parents' way to the hospital. She never lets me forget that she had to open
      her presents a day late because I was born.</p>

   <p>Speaking of my sister, she is my only sibling. We are 8 1/2 years apart, but I think that made for a really good
      friendship. We never fought over anything. We didn't fight over boys or friends or clothes simply because we were
      always in such different stages of life. She was a softball player, a chior kid and a thespian. She excelled in
      Spanish, math and music. I did my best to NOT follow in her footsteps, but it proved to be unavoidable. I ended up taking Spanish all 4 years of high school and spent 2 years in college as a Spanish major. I traveled to Guatemala twice and my dream was to be a high school Spanish teacher. My plans changed in college and I got my degree in Communication with a Spanish minor.</p>

      <header class="titles">Big Girl Job...</header>
      <p>I graduated college with absolutely no direction and no idea where I wanted to end up. My dad was a banker for 35 years and I used those connections to my advantage and started my first job as teller at US Bank. I genuinely loved that job. It was fast paced and it challenged me because it required me to organized, analytical and there was a strict set of rules to follow. I was able to build relationships with my regular customers and that was my favorite part. I never dreamed of working in banking, but after that job, I moved into lending and then into the back end of mortgage servicing.</p>

      <header class="titles">Love & Lifting...</header>
      <p>When I was in lending, I met my partner, Cody. We met at the gym and became quick friends. About a week into us dating, we coincidentally both had trips out of the county during the same week. I went on my second trip to Guatemala and he went on a trip to Japan. I helped him pack and we both spent a lot of time researching the conversion rate between US Dollars and Japanese Yen (&yen;). That week apart felt like a year, but it kind of solidified how much we liked each other. Cody and I could not be more different as people, but we compliment each other and balance each other out. He is fiercely analytical and I do almost everything based off of emotion. When I met him he was training as a powerlifter and I quickly followed suit. I was a softball player in high school and I was looking for a competitive outlet and powerlifting was perfect. I spent a year and a half training, getting stronger and working on form and I finally had the courage to sign up for a competition in May 2020. It was cancelled due to Covid, but I kept working and eventually competed in person in October of 2021.</p>

      <header class="titles">Cody the Coder...</header>
      <p>Cody was my coach during my competitions and never stopped helping me tweak my workouts and my form. Remember when I said he was analytical? Well, at first I didn't understand it and I almost thought it was a bad thing, but if I was my own coach, I would have given up well before I ever reached a competition. He never stops working on solutions to problems. Cody is also a software developer and one of the biggest reasons why I am enrolled in LC101. LC101 is more challenging than I ever thought it would be, but just like he pushes me to be a better powerlifter, he also pushes me to be a better coder. </p>

      <header class="titles">Thanks, LaunchCode...</header>
      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I want more for myself in my career and as a human being. Even if I decide that full-time software development isn't for me, I still believe that the I discipline I have learned and the community that is being built through LC is something I will carry with me.</p>
